# Data Science for Chemical Engineering Course

Welcome to the Data Science for Chemical Engineering course repository! This resource contains all learning materials, code examples, and projects designed to bridge core data science and Python programming skills with practical applications in chemical and process industries.

## Course Overview
This course empowers chemical engineers to:
- Automate calculations and repetitive tasks using Python
- Analyze, visualize, and process engineering data
- Apply programming to real-world scenarios such as mass/energy balances, process control, and quality assurance
- Leverage modern tools for optimization and decision-making in chemical engineering

## Repository Structure
- `Chapter1_PythonFundamentals/` — Jupyter notebooks covering Python basics, variables, math operations, type casting, booleans, and engineering logic
- `requirements.txt` — List of required Python packages
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` — For reproducible environments

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (or use the provided Docker setup)
3. Open the notebooks in your preferred environment (VS Code, JupyterLab, etc.)

## Topics Covered
- Python variables, types, and units in engineering
- Math operations and operator precedence
- Input handling and type casting
- Boolean logic and process decision-making
- Realistic engineering scenarios (mass balance, mixing, alarms, interlocks)

## Contributing
Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
