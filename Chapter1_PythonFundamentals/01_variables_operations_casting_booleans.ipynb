    "## 1.1.6. Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduced essential Python concepts for chemical and process engineering applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables & Types\n",
    "- Use descriptive variable names and always track **units** (e.g., `pressure_bar`, `T_C`).\n",
    "- Python supports `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool` types. Use `type()` to check a variable’s type.\n",
    "- Be careful with type flexibility and conversions (e.g., casting strings to numbers for calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math Operations\n",
    "- Python uses familiar math symbols: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`, `//`.\n",
    "- Operator precedence follows algebraic rules (parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).\n",
    "- Always ensure **unit consistency** in calculations.\n",
    "- Common engineering examples: mass/energy balances, mixing, Reynolds number, vessel volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input & Type Casting\n",
    "- Use `input()` to collect user data (always as a string).\n",
    "- Cast input to `int` or `float` before calculations.\n",
    "- Essential for real-world engineering where data comes from operators, sensors, or files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans & Comparisons\n",
    "- Boolean logic (`True`/`False`) is used for decision-making in engineering (alarms, interlocks, QA).\n",
    "- **Comparison operators:** `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`.\n",
    "- **Logical operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`.\n",
    "- Combine conditions to encode process rules, safety interlocks, and quality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Scenarios\n",
    "- Each concept was illustrated with practical examples: pressure alarms, flow checks, tank levels, batch release, pump interlocks, analyzer validation, and more.\n",
    "- Emphasis on translating engineering logic and calculations into clear, reliable Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering these Python fundamentals enables you to automate calculations, implement process logic, and build robust tools for chemical engineering tasks."
